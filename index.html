          What were Americans reading — during a pandemic, a financial crisis,
          after an election? Do books serve as an escape from the present, a
          source of information and education, or comfort? Do what Americans
          search on the web reflect what books they read? And, how might we
          foster an environment that encourages reading beyond the headlines? We
          explore these questions through a synthesis of data from Google
          Trends, New York Times Bestseller Lists, Google Books API, and Text
          Classification API. Our process of designing the relationship between
          current events and books began with a decision on the sources of data
          that convey what books people are reading and searching on the web. We
          created datasets from Google’s yearly trends and the New York Times
          bestseller lists of fiction and non-fiction books from 2006 to
          2019 — from the earliest publication of yearly data from Google trends
          in the U.S. to the latest publication of yearly data from NYT
          bestseller lists. We retrieved and stored additional information using
          Google Books API, including author names and book descriptions. We
          created an additional layer of information by generating classifying
          keywords from each book using Text Classification API. The integration
          required interpretations of data considering the multiple layers of
          interaction. The mapping of trends to books was based on time and
          relatedness: we created an array of related words for each trend and
          returned books in which the trend and related words appeared in the
          descriptions. The result fuses different sources of data to enable
          users to explore the content by time, then by keywords.
